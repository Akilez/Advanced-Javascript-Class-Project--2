This was an assignment from my advanced JavaScript class. It was the second project assigned by Dr. Lin Xie. The purpose was to demonstrate proficincy in use of a mixture of JavaScript APIs and plugins.

## Methodology

I started with the assumption that I would utilize the Bootstrap framework to gain further proficiency. I added jQuery to ensure Bootstrap would work. jQuery is also far easier and more robust that JavaScript alone.

From there, I included the carousel plugin provided for the project. Implementation was easy as the pre-work was provided by the instructor. Nevetheless, certain modifications were made to meet my final design.

After setting up the carousel and basic HTML, I began to code with Bootstrap to make the "lightbox". In Bootstrap the component I used is the modal. I added a bit of custom style code to give the modal its width, but in future iterations I would probably do this by editing and recompiling the LESS code.

Then I began to integrate the Google Maps API code. From here and at several other places I started the process of adding style, animation and embellishment to give the page a robust feel.
